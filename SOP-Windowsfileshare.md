# SOP: File Share Implementation via Windows Server 2019


## Purpose:
The purpose of this SOP is to guide Administrators in the implementation of a centralized file share system using Windows Server 2019. The file share will be established across all departments, providing a secure and efficient platform for collaborative document management.


## Scope:
This SOP applies to IT Administrators responsible for the implementation, following, and reviewing of the centralized file share system on Windows Server 2019.


### Responsibilities:
- Implementation: IT Administrators, CTO, COO.
- Following: IT Administrators
- Reviewing: CTO, COO


### Prerequisites:
- Windows Server 2019 installed and configured.
- Proper network configurations, including IP addresses and DNS settings.


### Procedure:
1. Identify File Share Requirements:
    - Collaborate with department heads to understand specific file share needs.
    - Determine access permissions and security requirements for each department.
2. Create File Share Structure:
    - Design a hierarchical folder structure based on departmental requirements.
    - Implement appropriate naming conventions for folders and files.
3. Configure File Share Permissions:
    - Set up access permissions for user groups based on departmental roles.
    - Implement security measures to restrict unauthorized access.
4. Enable Access Control:
    - Implement access control lists (ACLs) to control user permissions at the file and folder level.
    - Regularly review and update access controls as needed.
5. Establish Backup and Recovery Procedures:
    - Implement regular backup schedules for critical files and folders.
    - Document and test recovery procedures to ensure data integrity.
6. Monitor File Share Performance:
    - Implement monitoring tools to track file share usage and performance.
    - Address any performance issues promptly.


### Expected Results:
- Centralized file share system is successfully implemented across all departments.
- Departmental file structures are organized and follow naming conventions.
- Access permissions and security measures are effectively configured.
- Backup and recovery procedures are in place and tested.
- File share performance is monitored and meets user expectations.
